Precision at 7321: 0.9132632154077311

Confusion Matrix:
TP: 6686, FP: 635
FN: 635, TN: 6660
Accuracy: 0.9131
Precision: 0.9133
Recall/TPR: 0.9133
Specificity/TNR: 0.9130
FPR: 0.0870
FNR: 0.0867
F1 Score: 0.9133

Statistical Significance Tests:
Binomial test p-value (accuracy > 0.5): 0.0000e+00
Chi-square test p-value (independence): 0.0000e+00

Conclusion: The method shows statistically significant performance better than random guessing 
(binomial p-value = 0.0000e+00 < 0.05, chi-square p-value = 0.0000e+00 < 0.05). 
This validates the effectiveness of Gallé's method in distinguishing AI-generated (GPT-4o) text from human-written text on the small subset of Roy's dataset.
